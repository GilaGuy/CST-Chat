# CST Chat
CST Chat provides online chat rooms for CST students to chat in. Newcomers can use their my BCIT account to create a new CST Chat account to login with. Once logged in, the student can see all of the chat rooms available to join, and if they want, they can also create new ones. The chat rooms are stored online so they won't dissappear the next time someone wants to use it.
